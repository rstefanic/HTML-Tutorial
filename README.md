# HTML Tutorial

This HTML tutorial is aimed to get people who don't know anything about HTML, and to give the tools that they need to get started writing HTML. It doesn't assume any previous knowledge about HTML, and it tries to provide an extensive understanding of basic HTML without glossing over the details.

## Examples

One way that I'm trying to teach HTML is by giving examples. While the examples are simple, the act of actually practicing what you're reading is crucial.
